# ChatBot-Using-Langchain
This project is a LangChain-powered chatbot that allows users to ask questions about a PDF document and receive intelligent, context-aware answers. It uses Ollama LLMs (like LLaMA2 or Mistral), FAISS vector search, and custom prompt engineering to deliver concise responses based on retrieved document chunks.
